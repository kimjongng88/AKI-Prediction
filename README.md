- train_test_dataset_split.ipynb: contains the code to create the train and test splits for the different time windows.
- ERF.ipynb: contains the (R) code for ExpertRuleFit.  
- Time-series notebooks: This folder contains all code related to the transformer and lstm.
	- The notebooks are split according to their time window. For example, training_1hour has code related to training the time-series transformer, lstm and bi-lstm for the 1 hour window.
